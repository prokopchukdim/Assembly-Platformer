# Assembly-Platformer
 
An infinite-scrolling platformer I created in Assembly for the MIPS32 system as a final project for the CSCB58 course at UofT. The asm file can be ran with the MARS MIPS simulator, using the display and keyboard simulator tools. The settings for the display are included in the preamble of the asm file.

A video demonstration of which submission criteria the project covers: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rSV_AaGB5oU
